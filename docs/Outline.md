# Cricketeer

## Outline
An application to track cricket matches and leagues.

## Requirements
It should be able to manage a league of teams amongst many divisions. Each team will contain a number of players and from these players an 11 man side will be selected to play a match.

Players in the side should have a photo, some stats about their career and also their specialty (bowler, batsman, wicket keeper, allrounder). Also marking out the captain of the side.

Matches should be stored historically so a match score can be recalled with the players, their scores as well as a complete match scorecard. Various types of match should be available, Test Match, One Day and T20.

## Advanced
A ball-by-ball system allowing balls to be entered as they are played. Including the bowler, outcome of the ball, such as a wicket, a catch, stumping, no ball, wide, leg bye, etc.

There should also be the ability to cope with both UK County matches as well as International fixtures.

## Technical constraints
* PHP
* MySQL
* CakePHP 3
